# Django Sir Trevor Field

**Not ready for production!** Library in planning stage. No promises.

## Testing

We use [`tox`][tox] to run the tests, and [TravisCI][travis] for continuous
integration. To run the tests locally, install `tox`:

    pip install tox

and then run:

    make test

The test suite includes `flake8` and `isort`. This is an attempt to make it
easier to follow the opinionated code style preferences of this project.
